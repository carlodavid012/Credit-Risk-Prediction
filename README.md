# Credit-Risk-Prediction

In this project, i created a model to use historical loan application data to predict whether or not an applicant will be able to repay a loan. I used the [Home Credit dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk) available on kaggle. Home Credit is a financing company dedicated to providing loans to those with little or no credit history.
